# TODO: Write class declaration for the Pump

    # TODO: Create a constructor which:
    #       0. Takes no explicit parameters
    #       1. Sets a property called "throughput" to 20

    # TODO: Create method called "request_capacity" which:
    #       0. Takes no explicit parameters
    #       1. Returns a boolean
    #       2. Opens the reservoir file
    #       3. Returns if there's enough capacity to match throughput

    # TODO: Create method called "update_capacity" which:
    #       0. Takes no explicit parameters
    #       1. Opens the reservoir file and updates it to match
    #          the amount taken via throughput of the pump

    # TODO: Create a "use" method, which:
    #       0. Takes no explicit parameters
    #       1. Returns an integer which is
    #       1a. Equal to the throughput if there's water in the reservoir
    #       1b. Equal to 0 if there's nothing left
